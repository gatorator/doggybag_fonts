# doggybag_fonts
In 2019, when I was just starting college, I threw together some royalty free handwritten fonts for fun, called Elegantile and Anglerhand. They were received surprisingly well, so with the resulting boost in confidence I attempted to make a real, actual sans-serif font called Gunbangs. In 2021, to get myself out of a creative slump I made an experimental font called LW90 that was based on using rounded lines to carve negative space out of squares. I still see all of these fonts out in the wild to this day which is quite surprising to me. My first two have proven to be persistently popular with Twitter artists and Newgrounds users. I've decided to upload all of these fonts and their source files to GitHub to allow people to use them and improve upon them.
